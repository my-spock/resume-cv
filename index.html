                    <p>I want to be challenged.  I want to solve puzzles of logic.  I want to spend an hour trying to find
                        the problem with my code, only to discover that I was missing a curly bracket.</p>
                    <p>Okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea.</p>
                    <p>My one regret in life is not learning to code earlier.  I spent too long wandering
                        from major to major, looking for that magical combination that would satisfy me intellectually
                        and allow a creative outlet.  Sometimes I am overwhelmed by how much there is to learn
                        in the world of web development, but mostly I can't wait to figure it all out!</p>
                        <p>Add me to your team.  You won't regret it.</p>

                            that he gets to solve with logic!  I'm <b>LOVING</b> the back end side of web dev.</p></li>

                        <li>I started as a dishwasher here.  The schedule was hectic, but I was meticulous in my cleaning.
                            I wasn't making much money, so I informed my boss that I'd be looking for a new job.  They had been
                            so impressed by my work that they offered to promote me to a position as cook instead!  I was pretty
                            proud of that, because it was my first ever promotion and raise.  I bring the same (okay, probably more)
                             drive and passion to my programming.

                            can't overemphasize how I learned to handle stress, tight deadlines, and cleanliness.
                            Have you tried preparing a meal for 30 people in 4 hours?  How about handling snack requests
                            in the middle of it?  Oh no!  You only have enough meat for 5 people!  And you need to keep your
                             workstation clean and sanitized, avoiding cross-contamination.  Yeah, I can handle deadlines 
                             while keeping my code clean and well-structured.</p></li>
